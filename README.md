# MyReads Project
This a project completed in React for Udacity's Front-End Web Developmer Nanodegree course. I have added interactivity to the app by refactoring static code given. MyReads is a book tracking app that lets the user track books that they are currently reading, want to read, or have read. You can search, add and change the "shelf" that the book belongs to. Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

## To Start
To get started:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
